# ATtention Spanned
A collection of scripts used to automatically extract Android firmware images and process them for AT commands.
These scripts may be modified for other tasks, such as extracting specific files or merely extracting base filesystem images.

**NOTE: We are currently still in the disclosure process. Not all scripts are available.**
